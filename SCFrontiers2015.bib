@inproceedings{Sewell2012,
	Abstract = {This paper surveys the four software frameworks being developed as part of the visualization pillar of the SDAV (Scalable Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization) Institute, one of the SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing) Institutes established by the ASCR (Advanced Scientific Computing Research) Program of the U.S. Department of Energy. These frameworks include EAVL (Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization Library), DAX (Data Analysis at Extreme), DIY (Do It Yourself), and PISTON. The objective of these frameworks is to facilitate the adaptation of visualization and analysis algorithms to take advantage of the available parallelism in emerging multi-core and many-core hardware architectures, in anticipation of the need for such algorithms to be run in-situ with LCF (leadership-class facilities) simulation codes on supercomputers.},

@book{Blelloch1990,
	Abstract = {Vector Models for Data-Parallel Computing describes a model of parallelism that extends and formalizes the Data-Parallel model on which the Connection Machine and other supercomputers are based. It presents many algorithms based on the model, ranging from graph algorithms to numerical algorithms, and argues that data-parallel models are not only practical and can be applied to a surprisingly wide variety of problems, they are also well suited for very-high-level languages and lead to a concise and clear description of algorithms and their complexity. Many of the author's ideas have been incorporated into the instruction set and into algorithms currently running on the Connection Machine.

The book includes the definition of a parallel vector machine; an extensive description of the uses of the scan (also called parallel-prefix) operations; the introduction of segmented vector operations; parallel data structures for trees, graphs, and grids; many parallel computational-geometry, graph, numerical and sorting algorithms; techniques for compiling nested parallelism; a compiler for Paralation Lisp; and details on the implementation of the scan operations.},
